Player Pad Skin Store
Red, just like the vampires like it... I mean like the sun...
Carbon fibre has made its mark deeply on the society and on our pad.
(We did not know how to display transparent)
Just look at this pattern, just look at it. Our designer's pretty happy about himself for making this.
This image was taken straight from the depths of Tartarus.
When you buy this skin, your pad becomes a rebel.
This pad gives our designer Jeff the chills, maybe it reminds him of his days back in the asylum.
This pad may look cartoonic but he's actually very serious about his career in law.
Just like the pattern Jeff's grandma makes.
Wait, isnt this the same color as one of the block schemes? Are they reusing stuff?
